# Legacy documentation

These are the files that comprised Ractive's legacy documentation.

These were originally written custom - a mix of YAML front-matter, Markdown and Handlebars. It has been ported over to vanilla markdown using [Python Markdown](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/index.html) for portability. With this migration, there _may_ be some missing content, primarily broken links, orphaned pages, a few typos here and there. If you spot any, don't hesitate to open an issue. Even better, you can open a pull request!
