# Decorators


A decorator is a simple way to add behaviour to a node when it is rendered, or to augment it in some way. Decorators are a good way to teach Ractive tricks from other libraries, such as [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/).

You can use existing decorators from the [Plugins](Plugins.md) page, or you can easily create your own.


## Creating decorator plugins

See [Writing decorator plugins](Writing decorator plugins.md) to learn how to create your own decorators.
