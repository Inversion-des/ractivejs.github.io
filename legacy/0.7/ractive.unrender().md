# ractive.unrender()


Unrenders this Ractive instance, throwing away any DOM nodes associated with this instance. This is the counterpart to [ractive.render()](ractive.render().md). The rest of the ractive instance is left intact, unlike [ractive.teardown()](ractive.teardown().md).

> ### ractive.unrender()
> Returns a `Promise` (see [Promises](Promises.md))
