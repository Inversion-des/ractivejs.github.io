# Events


Like many libraries, Ractive implements the [publish/subscribe](http://addyosmani.com/blog/understanding-the-publishsubscribe-pattern-for-greater-javascript-scalability/) mechanism to allow you to respond to, or trigger, particular events.

```js
ractive = new Ractive({
  el: 'body',
  template: '<button on-click="activate">click me!</button>'
});

ractive.on( 'activate', function ( event ) {
  alert( 'Activating!' );
});
```

There are actually two-levels of event handling in Ractive:

> The lower-level interaction with DOM events or [custom events](Writing event plugins.md). These are specified using [template directives](Event directives.md) that also specify how the event is to be handled using either [proxy events](proxy events.md) or [method calls](method calls.md).

> The [publish-subscribe](publish-subscribe.md) api and event system within Ractive and between components. Proxy events bridge the DOM event into a Ractive event, whereas method calls directly invoke the ractive instance and do not use the pub/sub infrastructure.

<br>
The [publish-subscribe](publish-subscribe.md) event handling in Ractive allows you to consistently handle three different categories of generated events:

* [Proxy events](Proxy events.md), mentioned above, proxy DOM and custom events defined in your template
* [Lifecycle events](Lifecycle events.md) generated by each ractive instance - such as `init`, `render` and `teardown`
* [Custom events](Publish-subscribe.md#publish) fired in code using [ractive.fire()](ractive.fire().md), which can be anything you like

## Hygiene

One of the advantages of using Ractive events is that, in addition to being able to manually unsubscribe events, both DOM events and
Ractive Events will be automatically unsubscribed when the ractive instance or component is torndown.

In practice, this means adding a template directive like `on-click='select'` is all that is needed to manage the DOM event.
